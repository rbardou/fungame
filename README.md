# Fungame

A library to make simple 2D games in the OCaml functional programming
language. Based on SDL2, it handles 2D graphics, sound and text. It
also contains widget modules for user interfaces. This library has
been polished over and over while I was making countless unfinished
games.

This library is not released yet. To use it, clone the repository and
pin it with opam, or just vendor it.

An older version of this library is available in branch `original`.
This version tried to support JavaScript too, but not perfectly.
It tried to provide Widget support a la Funweb, but this approach proved
not composable enough.
